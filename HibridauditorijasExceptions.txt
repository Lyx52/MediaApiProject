Exceptions which will stop recording	
	- Epiphan recording or stream cannot be started? 			
		=> If epiphan is livestreaming then it can record, but can it record without livestreaming?
	- Opencast event can be created?
		=> If opencast fails to create event, does recording continue? 
			-> If continue
				- Advantage: Even if event is not cretated there still is recording to recover event from
				- Disadvantage: Event needs to be created and files uploaded manuallys (File stays on epiphan or gets uploaded somewhere?)
			-> If dont continue
				- Advantage: System will always try to work in the intended way, without any compensation or manual labor
				- Disadvantage: More chances of downtime
		=> If opencast fails to upload files? After recording is finished...
			->
